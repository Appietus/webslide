<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakthrough_Starshot">Starshot</a> aims to send solar sails to the nearest exoplanets in order to study them closely.</p>
<p>Solar sails need to weight only few grams so they can move quickly but cannot transport humans. They could transport seeds and zygotes but they cannot transport enough oxygen for them to survive a few decades flight.</p>
<p>We need a way to temporarily hibernate this cellular life so it won't use any oxygen until arriving on exoplanet. Assuming that such a way will get discovered, colonizing the stars will be cheap and fast.</p>
<p>We will send to those habitable exoplanets plants that will grow artificial wombs for human zygotes to develop. Radiation can be solved either by modifying life to use it as energy or by preserving hibernation for centuries longer - underwater plants will turn carbon dioxide into oxygen which will create the ozone layer.</p>
<p>There is a problem with rising the first generation of colonists. We need to teach them how to communicate with us and how to send their own Starshots to the stars beyond our reach. After overcoming this problem, the entire Milky Way will get colonized within a few million years.</p>
<p>Those lucky ones that will live close to the rotating black holes will be able to produce enormous amounts of energy for unimaginable experiments.</p>
